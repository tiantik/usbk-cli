About USB-K
===========
USB-K CryptoBridge encrypts data independent by the operation systems and all filesystems.
USB-K works in SCSI level and encrypts/decryps data on the fly. USB-K uses 3 keys and a
password for this operation. Whenever user inserts USB-K into USB Hub of the PC, USB-K
must be initialized (there is an exceptional situation!).

USB-K contains 3 keys by default. Each of which might be used by and USB disc device.
In order to use these 3 keys, user must enter the password. Password is 123456 by default.
If user enters incorrect password 3 times, all 3 keys are resetted by USB-K and the encrtypted
data becomes garbage. After that, there is NO WAY to save encrypted unless user
remember 128 bit long AES keys.

The 3 keys can be set by user, USB-K lets user to do this. If user note 128 bit long keys
to somewhere, data might be recovered.

USB-K causes 30% performance loss. Normally user doesn't feel anything unless user
read/write a big file.
